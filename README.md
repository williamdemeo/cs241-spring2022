## Course Description 

CS 241. Foundations of Computer Science I. 3 credits, 3 contact hours.

This course is an introduction to the foundations of computer science with emphasis on the development of techniques for the design and proof of correctness of algorithms and the analysis of their computational complexity. Reasoning techniques based on propositional and predicate logic and relational calculus operations with applications to databases will also be introduced. Auxiliary topics such as combinatorics of finite sets, functions and relations, and graph-theory definitions and graph storage alternatives will also be examined.

This course emphasizes the reading and writing of mathematical proofs.

*Prerequisites*. (CS 114 AND MATH 112) OR (CS 114 AND MATH 133).

## Reading Materials

### Primary Textbook

Students are expected to have access to the following textbook:

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321964683/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321964683&linkCode=as2&tag=typefunc-20&linkId=cf0db5f997d8bd0d8d8278c8d95ab54d"><img border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0321964683&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL110_&tag=typefunc-20" ></a>

[Discrete Mathematics, 8th ed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321964683/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321964683&linkCode=as2&tag=typefunc-20&linkId=ead5f0951025320305173ae6a9da9498)

**Edition**. 8th  
**ISBN**. 9780321964687  
**Author**. Johnsonbaugh  
**Publisher**. Pearson  
**Year**. 2018


### Secondary Textbook

[Logic and Proof](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/) by Avigad, Lewis, and van Doorn.
<!-- [(pdf)](https://github.com/williamdemeo/cs241-spring2022/blob/master/books/logic_and_proof_cu-edition.pdf) -->



-----------------------------------

## Programming Languages Information

See the [pl subdirectory](https://github.com/williamdemeo/cs370-spring2022/tree/master/pl).

-----------------------------------

## Attendance

Students are expected to attend all classes. A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences (whether excused or unexcused). Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) **five** absences in total, and you must <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=cs-241-absence">email the instructor</a> if/when you miss a class. Each additional absence, and any absence not mentioned to the instructor, may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.

Occasionally attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. If another student asks you to sign in for them, don't do it. Forging another student's signature constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to the Office of Judicial Affairs.

**Important:** If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture is over.

---

## Code of Conduct

Students must abide by [the university's code of conduct](https://www.njit.edu/dos/policies/conductcode/index.php).
In particular, cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to and dealt with by the Office of Judicial Affairs in a
manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the university.

---

## Use of Electronics During Lecture

**Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated to the course will not be tolerated.**

**Laptops may be used in the classroom only for work related to this course.**

As a general rule, students should silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets, microwave ovens, etc.) during all lectures and exam periods. There is only one exception to this rule: a laptop  or tablet may be used for, and only for, working on something related to the course material. 

Tiktoking, Tweeting, Tindering, Facebooking, Instagramming, Snapchatting, Whatsapping, YouTubing, and gaming are forbidden in the classroom.  Students should also refrain from emailing during class.  Such activities make it hard, if not impossible, for the student to concentrate on the lecture and can also be very distracting to the lecturer and other students.  Anyone who does not respect this policy will be asked to leave the classroom.

---

## Grading Policy

The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Homework: 30 points total  
+ Midterm exams: 30 points  
+ Final exam: 40 points  

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to the following table. However, the scale may be shifted depending on overall student performance.

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    


-----------------------------------

## Exams

**All exams take place in the usual classroom**, [ECEC 100][].

+  **MIDTERM EXAM**  
   **Topics**. Material covered in weeks 1 through 6 of [the course syllabus](https://github.com/williamdemeo/cs241-spring2022/tree/master/syllabus).  
   **DATE**. 8 Mar 2022


+  **FINAL EXAM** (cumulative)  
   **DATE**. TBA  
   **TIME**. TBA


In accordance with university policy, **the final exam must be taken by all students at the scheduled time in the usual classroom.** *Do not make plans which would have you depart campus before the scheduled final exam date.*

-----------------------------------
## Homework
The written homework assignments will account for 30% of the course grade and will be due every week on Friday (at the beginning of class) as indicated on [the course schedule](https://github.com/williamdemeo/cs241-spring2022/tree/master/schedule).

Here are some important facts about the homework policy in this class.

+ **You must submit a hard copy of your homework**; electronic submissions, e.g. email attachments, are not acceptable.
+ **Homework submitted at the end of class on the due date may be penalized.** 
+ **Homework submitted after the end of class on the due date will not be accepted or graded.**
+ **Homework is graded on correctness and overall presentation**, including clarity, legibility, and style.
 
The lowest (or missed) homework score will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.

Descriptions of each homework assignment will be available in the homework directory of this repository.  You are strongly encouraged to start the homework early, so that you will have time to get help from the instructor or [a tutor](#tutoring-service) if you need it.

-----------------------------------
## Make-up Policy
**No late homework will be accepted for any reason.**  If you fail
to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt
your final course grade since the lowest homework score will be dropped.

Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, 
if you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,
then you might be able to take a make-up exam *before the scheduled exam time*.

To request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of
one of the following:

+  Documented medical excuse (student's own medical emergency).
+  Documented medical excuse (a member of the student's family has a medical emergency).
+  Extra curricular activity sponsored by NJIT.
+  Armed forces deployment (military duty).
+  Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.
+  A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a given day.  (In each case the exam with the fewest students must arrange the make-up exam.)

If you miss the midterm exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an explanation.
If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Asking Questions

Students are strongly encouraged to ask lots of questions.
If you don't understand something, please ask!

1. **In Lecture.** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **On Canvas.** Another good place to ask a question is the online discussion forum.  The Canvas system is designed to provide help quickly and efficiently.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Canvas.

---------------------------------

## Tutoring Service

"YWCC and its ACM student chapter have partnered to create an online tutoring program available to undergraduate and graduate students looking for tutoring assistance."

See [computing.njit.edu/tutoring](https://computing.njit.edu/tutoring) for more information.

The undergraduate tutoring schedule is available at [computing.njit.edu/undergraduate-tutoring-1](https://computing.njit.edu/undergraduate-tutoring-1)


------------

## Email Policy

You may email the instructor directly, though the response time might be a slower than if you use one of the preferred methods described above.

If you email the instructor, please use an informative subject field. Using 
[this link](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=CS 241: (fill in subject here)&body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)) will populate your message fields with some of the required information.  
If you do not at least indicate which class you are in, your email will be at risk of going unanswered.

---------------------------------------------

## Students With Disabilities

If you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the [Office of Accessibility Resources and Services](https://www.njit.edu/studentsuccess/node/5) for information 
on appropriate policies and procedures. 
The next step is to talk to the instructor who will be happy to assist with 
accommodations, but **will not provide them retroactively** 
(so file the appropriate requests and paperwork well before the first exam!).

Students must have their paper work in order and should contact the instructor 
early in the semester in order to have their learning needs appropriately met.
